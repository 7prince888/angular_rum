# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions — angular_rum

Summary
- This repository currently contains two top-level entries: the `All Infra` directory and `node_middle` (contains `app.ks`). There is no README or build/test scripts discovered.

Quick facts (discovered)
- Key path: [node_middle/app.ks](node_middle/app.ks) — currently an empty Kotlin script file.
- Infra: [All Infra](All%20Infra) — contains infrastructure artifacts; treat changes here as high-risk.

What an AI agent should do first
- Do NOT make irreversible infra changes in `All Infra` without explicit maintainer approval.
- Open an issue or ask the maintainer before adding build tooling or CI config (no existing CI files discovered).
- When touching code, prefer small, well-scoped PRs and call out missing project-level docs in the PR description.

Project-specific patterns and examples
- There are no existing package manifests (package.json, pom.xml, build.gradle) or tests in the repository root. If you need a build command, ask the maintainer rather than guessing.
- Example file to reference when editing: [node_middle/app.ks](node_middle/app.ks). If this file is empty, request spec or intended behavior before implementing.

How to propose changes
- Create a branch named `feat/brief-description` or `fix/brief-description` and include a short rationale in the PR body.
- For infra edits under [All Infra](All%20Infra), include an architecture note and request an explicit reviewer with infra rights.

When you cannot find information
- If tests, build scripts, or run instructions are missing, ask the user for the canonical commands and preferred CI before adding automation.

Contact & escalation
- If unsure about making a change that touches infrastructure or global repo layout, stop and ask: "Can I modify infra or add CI?" Provide the minimal change you intend.

Notes for maintainers
- This file was generated by an agent after scanning the repo. Add project-specific build/test commands and code owners to improve future agent productivity.

If you'd like, I can: add a minimal README, propose a sample CI workflow, or scaffold a `package.json`/`build.gradle` — tell me which and provide preferred commands.
